### TASK_1
# Credit Scoring Model Objective: Predict an individual's creditworthinessCredit Scoring Model

# Objective: Predict an individual's creditworthiness using past financial data.

# Approach: Use classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest.

## Key Features:

● Feature engineering from financial history.

● Model accuracy assessment using metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC.

● Dataset could include: income, debts, payment history, etc.




### TASK 2: Emotion Recognition from Speech

# Objective: Recognize human emotions (e.g., happy, angry, sad) from speech audio.

# Approach: Apply deep learning and speech signal processing techniques.

## Key Features:

● Extract features like MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients).

● Use models like CNN, RNN, or LSTM.

● Datasets: RAVDESS, TESS, or EMO-DB.
